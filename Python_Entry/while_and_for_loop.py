# Exercise:

# Ask the user to choose one of two options:
# if they type 'p', our program should print "Hello" and then ask the user again. Keep repeating this until...
# if they type 'q', our program should terminate.
 
# Let's begin by asking the user to type either 'p' or 'q':
# user_input = input("Enter q or p: ")
 
# # Now we must repeat until they type 'q':
# while user_input != "q":
#     # Inside our loop, check if they typed 'p'. If they did, print "Hello"
#     if user_input == "p":
#         print("Hello")
#     # Now we must ask the user for their input againâ€”otherwise we would be in an infinite loop!
#     user_input = input("Enter q or p: ")
